# Tailwind

Basic construction of an example Edith mock up using vanilla HTML to help teach me Tailwind CSS. Building is pretty standard, components used aren't properly named and there are no further connections attached to any of the links, but I learnt how to use it which was amazing! 

## Basic build instructions
install the modules

``` npm install ```

build the css files

``` npm run build ```

run with live-server at http://127.0.0.1:8080/ (should open up automatically)

``` live-server ```
